            <h3>Who am I?</h3>

            <p>I really like to create things. All sorts of things. Let this be handcrafted projects, digital
                projects, movie making or just doodling. I like the idea of
                making something from scratch, where, on the way, I have to solve countless problems. I have a couple of
                short documentaries and film projects under my belt, where I was a director,
                editor, camera operator, and a very bad actor. :)</p>
            <p>I studied at the University of Ljubljana in the fields of Cultural and Communication studies. This helped
                me to develop great empathy and understanding of other people. I try
                to put a lot of thought into how things will be used. I am currently focused on the basics of UX design,
                creating digital products in a lean and agile way.</p>
            <p>I would describe myself as a very responsible, precise and easygoing person. I enjoy working in a team
                where people collaborate, but I can also be very independent when
                there is a need for that. Professionally, I see myself in a creative field, where I can contribute to
                the product success with my design and problem-solving skills.</p>
